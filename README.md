### Sol LeWitt (1928-2007)
#### Was an American artist known for his Wall Drawings, of which he made over 1,200 in his lifetime. Each Wall Drawing was accompanied by a set of instructions that allowed others to recreate the piece. The instructions detailed the position, shape, and color of elements in the drawing. His instructions left much open to interpretation so that no two installations were identical. His work holds an important place in the modern art movement, where any##one can be an artist.
